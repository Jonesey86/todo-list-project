* This is a project that we worked on whilst learning at KodeHode.

* Combining both frontend skills and backend skills, We managed to make and design a fully functioning To-Do-List App.

* I stood for the Frontend design aspect of this project, whilst a colleague took the Backend aspect to make it work in the terminal.
